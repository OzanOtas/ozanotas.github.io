I am a **postdoctoral researcher** with a 8+ years of experience in cancer biology, immuno-oncology and gene regulation. Most recently, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Leibniz Institute on Aging – Fritz Lipmann Institute (FLI) in Jena, investigating how cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ signaling and mechanical cues shape tumor behavior.

I completed my **doctoral degree** (*magna cum laude*) at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin, where I investigated BAP1's role in gene regulatory networks and epigenomic regulation in uveal melanoma.

My long-term scientific motivation is to understand how cells interpret mechanical and biochemical signals to drive aggressive cancer phenotypes and to translate these findings toward therapeutic strategies. I enjoy combining molecular biology, imaging and functional genomics approaches with a critical, curiosity-driven mindset.

Here, you’ll find an overview of my research projects, publications, protocols and my ongoing work. I’m always open to collaboration, discussion and scientific exchange.
