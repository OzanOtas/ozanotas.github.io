In this work, we show that scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM), combined with an activatable MMP probe, can detect proteolytic activity in cancer cells through acoustic impedance shifts. Using MMPSense 680, SAM uniquely distinguished MMP-driven cleavage events in HT1080 cells, validated by confocal imaging and viability controls. These findings position SAM as a powerful, non-optical platform for probing MMP activity and its roles in cancer progression.
