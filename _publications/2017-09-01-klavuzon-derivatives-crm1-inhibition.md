We synthesized nine novel 4'-alkyl klavuzon derivatives and uncovered a sharp structure–activity relationship driven by substituent size. Small 4'-substituents enabled potent CRM1 inhibition but also increased cytotoxicity toward healthy pancreatic cells, revealing a critical selectivity trade-off. Larger substituents abolished CRM1 activity yet yielded the most cytotoxic compound in the series, which effectively suppressed growth of HuH-7–derived 3D spheroids. These findings highlight how subtle steric modifications at the 4'-position fundamentally reshape klavuzon anticancer profiles.
