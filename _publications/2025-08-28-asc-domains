ASC is a dual-domain adaptor that drives inflammasome assembly, yet how its PYD and CARD domains coordinate speck formation has remained unclear. Using domain-specific mutants fused to fluorescent reporters, we uncovered residue-level cooperative mechanisms that either promote or disrupt ASC homo-oligomerization. Our imaging and FRET analyses reveal that PYD–PYD and CARD–CARD interfaces contribute cumulatively rather than independently, exposing previously unrecognized “enhancer” and “breaker” residues. These findings redefine the molecular logic of ASC polymerization and provide a mechanistic framework for understanding its dysregulation in cancer and autoimmune diseases.
