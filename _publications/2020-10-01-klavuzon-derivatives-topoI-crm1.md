We synthesized a panel of 2'-alkoxymethyl klavuzon derivatives and evaluated their anticancer potential across 2D and 3D cancer models. Several derivatives displayed potent Topo I inhibition, while CRM1 activity was diminished compared to previously studied 4'-alkyl analogs. Notably, the isobutoxymethyl derivative showed strong selectivity toward pancreatic cancer cells, and the most cytotoxic compound suppressed growth in HuH-7–derived 3D spheroids with clear, concentration-dependent cell death. These results highlight alkoxymethyl-substitution as a promising strategy for refining klavuzon-based anticancer agents.
